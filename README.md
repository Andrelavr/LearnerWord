# Learner Word

Learner Word is a small application created as a personal dictionary of the English language. Learner Word has several games for memorizing words, for example, a word constructor, cards with words, and crossword puzzles. For words in the dictionary, you can look at examples of their use in books. Information about new words can be entered manually or taken from Google Translator and [WordNet](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn). All books are taken from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org).

The project is written in Python using the Kivy framework.
