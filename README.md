# Learner Word

Learner Word is a small application created as a personal dictionary of the English language. Learner Word has several games for memorizing words, for example, a word constructor, cards with words, and crossword puzzles. For words in the dictionary, you can look at examples of their use in books. Information about new words can be entered manually or taken from Google Translator and [WordNet](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn). All books are taken from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org).

The project is written in Python 3 using the Kivy framework.

## How to use

First of all, you need to go to the "Settings" screen and select the language into which the words will be translated

After entering the text, you can see its meaning, examples of use, translation, and synonyms.
You can click on a translation to add (or remove) that translation to your dictionary or click on any other word to add it to your dictionary.
Once you have added new words and saved them, you can play one of the games.
